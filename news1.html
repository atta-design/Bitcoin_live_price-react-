        <h1>Net inflows imply investor intention to sell, while consistent outflows represent strong holding sentiment.</h1>
        
        <p>A blockchain indicator tracking the flow of coins in and out of centralized exchanges is signaling a bearish
             shift in investor sentiment similar to the one seen before the May 2021 crash.</p>
             <ul>

<li> <p>Glassnode data shows the 90-day moving average of net exchange flows has turned positive, meaning more coins are
                  entering exchanges than leaving.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Sustained net inflows, if any, would be a cause for concern for the bulls.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Net inflows imply investor intention to sell, while consistent outflows represent strong holding sentiment 
                      and take out circulating supply from the market, paving the way for price rallies.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Net inflows imply investor intention to sell, while consistent outflows represent strong holding sentiment and take out 
                      circulating supply from the market,
                       paving the way for price rallies.</p></li>
                  <li><p>The metric consistently signaled outflows with a negative print throughout bitcoin’s 10-fold rally to over $60,000 observed in 11 
                      months to April 2021.</p></li>
                  <li><p>A similar pattern was observed in October 2021 when bitcoin rallied 40% to new record highs above $65,000.</p></li>
<li><p>The Federal Reserve’s December meeting minutes and the U.S. jobs data scheduled for release later this week may inject volatility into the bitcoin market.</p></li>
<li><p>According to FXStreet, the U.S. economy is expected to have added 400,000 jobs in December after November’s 210,000 additions. Strong data may strengthen the dollar and weight over bitcoin and asset
     prices, in general.</p></li>
