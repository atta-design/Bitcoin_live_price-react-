                <p>The government of India is reportedly planning to make additional changes to the crypto bill.
                     The “Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2021” is currently
                     listed to be considered in the winter session of parliament.</p>
        
                     <p>
                        However, a senior government official told Business Today Thursday that the government is considering reworking
                         the bill and will likely introduce it in the budget session in February.
                         According to the unnamed official:
                     </p>
                     <p>Discussions are ongoing and key issues like the treatment of private cryptocurrencies, the rationale of regulation and global practices is being
                          looked into once again.</p>
                          <p>The Indian government calls all cryptocurrencies that are not issued by the central bank “private cryptocurrencies,”
                               including bitcoin and ether.</p>
                               <p>In addition, NDTV similarly reported Wednesday that the government is planning to make some changes to the bill.
                                    Citing unnamed sources, the publication said the government wants India’s crypto regulation to be in tandem with the global framework but does not want to rush on the crypto law.
                                    The news outlet added:</p>
                                    <p>More changes are likely in the crypto bill … and the Centre might consider bringing an ordinance or special order after the session.</p>
